Adapol: adaptive pole fitting for quantum many-body physics
============================================================
`Adapol <https://github.com/flatironinstitute/adapol>`_  (pronouced "add a pole") is a python package for fitting Matsubara functions with pole expansions. 
Current applications include bath fitting and analytic continuation. The name ``Adapol`` is short for **adaptive pole fitting**.


Getting started
----------------
To use Adapol, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install adapol


Learn how to use it in the :ref:`documentation`.

For updates and latest versions, see `Github <https://github.com/flatironinstitute/adapol>`_.
